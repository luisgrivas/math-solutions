\begin{problem}{4}
Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold and $\tau: M \rightarrow M$ a fixed point free involution, that is, $\tau$ is a diffeomorfphism with $\tau \circ \tau = Id_M$ and $\tau(x) \neq x$ for all $x.$ 

Show that the quotient space $M/\tau$, which is obtained from $M$ by identification of points corresponding to each other under $\tau$, is a topological manifold which possesses exactly one differentiable structure with respect to which the projection $M \rightarrow M/\tau$ is locally diffeomorphic.

\begin{problem}{8}
Provide the complex projective sapce $\C P^n$ with the structure of a $2n-$dimensional differentiable manifold. This space is defined as follows: on the complex vector space $\C^{n+1},$ one has the equivalence relation $x \sim y$ if and only if there is a number $\lambda \in \C$, $\lambda \neq 0$, so that $\lambda x = y$. The quotient space $(\C - \{0\}) / \sim $ is defined to be $\C P^n$.

\end{problem}


\begin{problem}{14}

\begin{problem}{19}
The set $C^\infty(M)$ is an algebra under the natural addition and multiplication of functions. A differentiable mapping $f: M \rightarrow N$ defines an algebra homomorphism
$$

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] $\mathrm{M}_p$ is a maximal ideal of $C^\infty(M).$
\item[(b)] If $M$ is compact and $\mathrm{M} \in C^\infty(M)$ is a maximal ideal, then tehere exists some $p \in \mathrm{M}$ such that $\mathrm{M} = \mathrm{M}_p.$
