\begin{problem}{1}
Suppose $\mu(X) = 1, $ and suppose $f$ and $g$ are positive measurable functions on $X$ such that $fg \ge 1$. Prove that
$$ \int_X f d\mu \cdot \int_X g d\mu \ge 1.$$    
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Since $1 \le fg $, then $1 \le \sqrt{fg}$. By the HÃ¶lder inequality we have
$$1 \le \int_X  \sqrt{fg} \ d\mu  = \left(\int_X f\ d\mu\right)^{1/2} \cdot  \left(\int_X g\ d\mu\right)^{1/2}.$$
If we square both sides of the inequality we get the result.
\end{proof}
